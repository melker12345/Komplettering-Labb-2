BUGS:


TODO:

Login: 
    - Allow the user to log in and log out. [DONE]
        - One button that renders Login if the user is signed in and Logged out.
    
    - If the user is logged in, the user should be able to.
        - Create a new blog post, maybe an md editor page?
        - Delete an existing blog post.
        - See likes.


View blogs:

    Each blog routs the user to the url :to="`/blogs/${blog.id}`.
    That page should display the full blog nicely.
    Every blog specific page should follow the same structure.




Maybe:

- Allow logged in users to modify blogs.
- Markdown editor? how ward is it to implement? 


- Filter?
- Search?
- Pagination?
- Sort?
