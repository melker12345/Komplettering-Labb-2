TODO:

Login:
- Allow the user to log in and log out
    - One button that renders Login if the user is signed in and Logged out
- If the user is logged in, the user should be able to 
    - Create a new blog post
    - Delete an existing blog post 
    - See likes 

If user is signed in
- Create a blog
- Edit a blog
- Delete a blog
- see likes




Maybe:

- Filter?
- Search?
- Pagination?
